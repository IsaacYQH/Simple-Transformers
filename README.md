# Simple-Transformers
Implementation of simples transformers, including BERT for text classification and simple GPT using AliBi as positional encoding.

## Included Models
1. BERT text classifier in `train_scripts/EncoderClassifier.sh`
2. Basic GPT in `train_scripts/GPT.sh`
3. GPT with AliBi as positional encoding in `train_scripts/GPT.sh` (adapted from [https://github.com/jaketae/alibi](https://github.com/jaketae/alibi))
